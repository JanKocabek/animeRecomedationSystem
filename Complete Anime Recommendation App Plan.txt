Complete Anime Recommendation App Project Plan
📋 Project Requirements

Framework: Spring Boot + Thymeleaf
Database: MySQL (containerized)
Structure: 3+ tables, 2+ relationships
Frontend: 5+ views with different URLs
Forms: At least 1 POST form with validation
Timeline: 1 month
Goal: Portfolio-ready backend application

🗃️ Database Design
sql-- Core tables from Kaggle dataset
Users (id, username, email, password, created_at)
Anime (anime_id, title, genre, year, episodes, avg_rating)
UserRatings (user_id, anime_id, rating, date_rated)

-- Relationships:
-- Users 1:N UserRatings
-- Anime 1:N UserRatings
📊 Data Source
Primary: Kaggle dataset with user_id, anime_id, rating columns

Enables collaborative filtering recommendations
Real user behavior data for personalized suggestions

Future Enhancement: Jikan API integration (if time allows)
🏗️ Architecture Approach
Phase 1: REST API Backend (Weeks 1-2)

Build complete REST API endpoints
Database integration with containerized MySQL
User authentication & authorization
Data validation
Recommendation engine logic
Test with Postman

Phase 2: Frontend (Weeks 3-4)
Option A: HTML5 + Bootstrap + Vanilla JS (recommended for portfolio)
Option B: Thymeleaf + Bootstrap (meets requirements safely)
🔧 Technology Stack
Backend

Spring Boot (main framework)
Spring Security (authentication)
Spring Data JPA (database)
MySQL (containerized database)
SLF4J + Logbook (logging, not System.out.println)
Bean Validation (form validation)

Frontend

HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript (or Thymeleaf)
Bootstrap (styling)
Fetch API (HTTP requests)

DevOps & Tools

Docker (MySQL container, later full app)
Docker Compose (orchestration)
Maven (build tool)
JUnit + Mockito (testing)

🌐 Application Views/URLs

/ - Home page with featured anime
